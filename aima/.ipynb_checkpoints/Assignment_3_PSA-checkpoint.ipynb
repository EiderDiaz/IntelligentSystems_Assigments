    "Bread-First Search (BFS) proved to be the best algorithm for this assignment. Since BFS is optimal in terms steps taken by the agent and memory usage was not an issue for this assignment, we were able to execute the algorithm in all five boards as depicted on the Results Table above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depth-First Search (DFS) was on-par with BFS in terms of execution time for the simplest board, but quickly proved to be unusable in our machines. We think the problem executing the DFS algorithm is caused by the high order of branching on the trees where each branch also runs very deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Same for Depth Level Search (DLS), while on the first two boards provided acceptable solutions, from the third board on we were unable to complete a single execution of the algorithm. This was the case as well for Iterative Depth Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "While uninformed search is very basic and rarely useful in real-world examples, it was a very good way to get acquainted with the basics of searching in the space of the solution. With more sophisticated techniques such as informed learning algorithms and heuristics we might be able to drastically improve on the execution for some of these algorithms.\n",

    "NOTE: we only included code for executing BFS, but swapping-in other algorithms should not represent a problem."
