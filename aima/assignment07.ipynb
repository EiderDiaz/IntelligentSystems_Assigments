    "## Set-Covering Problem \n",
    "\n",
    "In a set-covering model, each member of a given set (set 1) must be “covered” by an acceptable member of another set (set 2). The objective in a set-covering problem is to minimize the number of elements in set 2 that are needed to cover all of the elements in set 1. \n",

    "<b>i) How do you describe and codify a solution and how will you represent it in Python for the chosen method?</b>\n",
    "To codify the solution to the Set-Covering Problem using Simulated Annealing, we use the code provided by AIMA. We stated this problem as an optimization problem, where we would try to minimize the number of cameras used from the initial set of twelve.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>ii) How do you generate the initial solution(s)?</b>\n",
    "The initial solution was formed by using all 12 cameras to cover the 25 zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>iii) How are the neighbors (or offspring) of the current solution(s) generated during the execution of the method?</b>\n",
    "For each state, neighbors were generated by a couple methods. The first method for generating neighbors was deleting each one of the existing cameras, through this we obtained N neighbors (where n is the total cameras in the current state of the solution). The other method was, where possible, add one of the unused cameras to the solution, through which we obtained additional M neighbors (where M is 12 - N).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>iv) How do you calculate the objective function (or fitness) you want to optimize?</b>\n",
    "The objective function was calculated in two steps. First, we check for the feasibility of the solution. For a solution to be feasible, we considered that it must cover all 25 zones, zones 1 and 2 must be covered by at least two cameras and camera 7 must be part of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once clearing that the solution was feasible, we considered the number of cameras used as the number we wanted to minimize.\n"
