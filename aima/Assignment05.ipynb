    "### The main questions that you must answer during the development of this activity are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the main features of the game that can make a player of any type win or lose?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. lets start with one of the main features to take into account is the number of legal action that can be perfomed considering its current position, as we can observate in the following figure there is 8,5,4,3,2 posible moves (cell-point system) that can be perfomed in diferent locations along the board (assuming there all legal actions), the heurisic we propose evaluates the position of both max a min according to a cell-point system and returns the difference of the max defense value and min defense value: \n",

    " \n",
    "<H3 align = \"center\">  Figure 1 </H3>\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Another feature we take into cosideration is estimating if there is a move that blocks the oponent next move in order to win the game, this estimation has the following ponderations: 3 if its is trapped in the corner of the board, 2 if is vulnerable on the edge of the board and 0 \n",
    "\n",
    " <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EiderDiaz/IntelligentSystems_Assigments/master/Support%20for%20assigment%205/attack.png?token=AEH26VH7MKIQQGORXBJH5PK5RQUZM\" width=500 height=500>\n",
    "<H3 align = \"center\">  Figure 2 </H3>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. the last intuition we have in order to create a feature we took it from chess and its simple, we just to evaluate the  eucledian distance to center of the board for both max and min and return the distance of max minus min.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How easy is it to implement those features in computer systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. in the first case the feature (that we name it defense because it plays defensive in order to keep the maximum posible moves) it was easy to implement , the calculation that we have to code are just simple if statements in order to know the cell-point score (see figure 1) of min and max player and subtracting max´s score from min. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. in the second case (we name it attack because it plays aggressive), this feature keeps an eye on the board in order to check if there is a legal move that traps the another agent and by consecuence win the match, to implement that we just calculate if our agent is at 1 move to the the oponent posible moves and and then assign a ponderations (3,2,0) respectivly, if our agent isn´t at 1 move from the agent posible moves it just returns -1 in order to promote agression, (the calculations are bilateral).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. there isn´t any complication just calculate the euclidean distance to the center\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Are they worth considering according to the computational cost of their implementation? \n",
    " All 3 runs in a time complexity of O(1), because all just use arithmetic operations with no loops inside so, all 3 seems pretty worthing, compared to search approaches that uses a lot computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is it possible to include strategies within an evaluation function?  How? \n",
    "yes it is posible, thanks to the heuristics, which are components of the evaluation function, and together with the weights assigned to each heuristic, they achieve a considerably good performance at a significantly lower computational cost\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In what way is it possible to adjust the weights assigned to the features in the evaluation function? \n",
    "\n",
    "it is posible, one way is to use brute force and evaluate several weights on each feature and calculate the performance or averages. Another more sophisticated way is to implement sort of genetic algorithms and make round-robin tournaments assign random weights on features, then get the weights of the agents winning features generate some childs and mutate it a little bit, and repit the whole process several times. \n",
