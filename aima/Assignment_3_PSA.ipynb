    "a PSA. Choose a way to represent states in the programming language (Python).\n",
    "2. Implement the required code in a jupyter notebook to be able to solve different\n",
    "instances of the problem using the blind search methods already programmed and\n",
    "included in the Python AIMA code.\n",
