    "1. Analyze the problem to determine the information that is relevant to its formulation as\n",
    "a PSA. Choose a way to represent states in the programming language (Python).\n",
    "2. Implement the required code in a jupyter notebook to be able to solve different\n",
    "instances of the problem using the blind search methods already programmed and\n",
    "included in the Python AIMA code.\n",
    "3. Your code must work correctly when being used by the functions that implement the\n",
    "respective search methods.\n",
    "4. Execute the blind search methods to solve the above possible board problems showing\n",
    "the best solutions found. Each solution must properly show the sequence of states and\n",
    "actions by displaying the step number, the chosen action and the resulting state.\n",
    "5. It would be very nice and awarded if you can compute any statistics about the behaviors\n",
    "of the distinct methods.\n",
